/*

This theme uses Grunt tasks to build and minify the styles.

If WP_DEBUG is set to TRUE, css/style.css is loaded (for development).
IF WP_DEBUG is set to FALSE, css/style.css.min is loaded (for production).

If you wish to add styles, there are a number of options:

1. Use the JetPack CSS module and override styles inline.
2. Create a child theme and add styles to the style.css of your child theme.
3. Edit styles in sass folder directly and use Grunt build tasks.
